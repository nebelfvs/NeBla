# **Portable device and mobile application for the detection of ultraviolet radiation in real-time with a low-cost Arduino sensor.**
   
**Mobile application images**

In these images you will find the operation of the mobile application that connects to the kit UvReader.

**Measurements made.**

**In order to obtain the results of the UV radiation index for this project, respectively; we place two prototypes in the north and south in the city of Guayaquil 2 째 09'25.8 "S 79 째 56'01.8" W and 2 째 13'39.2 "S 79 째 54'13.9" W. The data is collected in the date range from April 7, 2019, until July 28, 2019. The schedule is established for the measurement of UV rays in the period from April to July are from 07:00:00 to 19:00:00. The sensor results are measured in (mW/cm2) and the corresponding voltage for each UV unit.**
